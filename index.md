Note: Thanks to everyone for coming. I’ve got my contact information up on
this slide, and I’ll show it again at the end, because this material is new to
the public, though I’ve been kicking it around in my head for a few years. So
please tweet at me, etc., if you think of something later or didn’t want to
ask during discussion, or whatever.

# What Is Tiny DH?

Note: I'm going to be talking today about tiny DH. As far as I can tell, I put
the word “tiny” in front of “digital humanities” for the first time, but the
ideas here strike me as rather straightforward and boast a strong intellectual
lineage that I’ve only built upon. Rather explicitly, it has consonances with
Minimal Computing and Micro DH, about which more below. Also explicitly, it is
a practice in tension or perhaps even critique of Big DH. About which, of
course, also more below.

But before talking about friends and family of Tiny DH, I want to note that,
internally, I’ve been calling it mushroom DH with friends and colleagues. To
me, Tiny + mushroom means it should actually be called Toad DH, so here we
are. Hopefully the picture here is one of Toad’s being overwhelmed by
recognition of the DH that bears his name, as opposed to bowled over by
something unmanageable. 

As for the code name Mushroom DH, well its provenance is clear.

> A rush of stories cannot be neatly summed up. Its scales do not nest neatly;
they draw attention to interrupting geographies and tempos…
Yet it is just these interruptions that step out of the bounds of
most modern science, which demands the possibility for infinite expansion
without changing the research framework. Arts of noticing are considered
archaic because they are unable to “scale up” in this way.

--> Tsing, _The Mushroom at the End of the World_, 37–38

Note: In the Mushroom at the End of the World, Anna Tsing accomplishes a feat
of making a case for an assemblage-driven anthropology that works even harder
to ensure that the communities studied are made up of more than humans. 

This passage gathers a few of Tsing’s terms and help set the stage for what
illuminate what Toad DH, Tiny DH, whatever, might look like. The four terms
are “rush of stories,” “scale,” “science,” and “arts of noticing,” and as I
show how Tsing talks about them, I ask you all to imagine an object of inquiry
like a novel in this space. 

That is, Tsing is talking about the massive assemblage of matsutake mushrooms
that includes their symbiotic pine trees, the often refugee pickers from
southeast Asia who harvest the mushrooms in the Oregon forests, and the rest
that is Tsing, as an anthropologist,’s concern.

## “A rush of stories”

> If a rush of troubled stories is the best way to tell about contaminated
diversity, then it’s time to make that rush part of our knowledge practices.
Perhaps, like the war survivors themselves, we need to tell and tell until all
our stories of death and near-death and gratuitous life are standing with us
to face the challenges of the present [and so] we might encounter our best
hopes for precarious survival.

--> Tsing, _Mushroom_, 34.

Note: Contamination is a means by which something can become greater than the
sum of its parts, the means by which an object can exhibit emergent
properties. For Tsing, contamination is what we may call being affected, or
being in encounter with. For me, that sounds a lot like reading, where in
reading a text, the reader allows for an affective and aesthetic encounter,
where the reader remains afterward changed. Not only that, but a novel itself
is a nest of encounters. Mikhail Bakhtin discusses the polyphony of the novel,
and Tsing uses “polyphonic” to modify the assemblages tracked in the book.

As polyphonies, the stories and voices rush in all at once, within just this
single object, this single novel. And the reader listens for both moments of
distance, when the voices are far from each other, and moments of harmony or
assonance, when they briefly converge and contaminate.

This rush of stories can overwhelm, like Toad in the earlier slide, and this
rush echoes Lauren Berlant’s idea of genre flailing, responding to crisis by
improvising like crazy. As Berlant writes, “The violence of the world makes us
flail about for things to read with, people to talk to, and material for
inducing transformations... [so that we may] be disturbed together, thrashing
with, and creating value through a shift in the object.” Being disturbed
together, like being contaminated together, becomes an act of solidarity.
