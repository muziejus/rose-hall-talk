Note: Thanks to everyone for coming. I’ve got my contact information up on
this slide, and I’ll show it again at the end, because this material is new to
the public, though I’ve been kicking it around in my head for a few years. So
please tweet at me, etc., if you think of something later or didn’t want to
ask during discussion, or whatever.

Note: First, a word of warning. Seeing as this paper is part of a panel
entitled “evaluating the future,” and seeing that developing and delivering
software is really tricky when the development team is just one person, me,
I’ve reframed what I want to talk about a little bit. Instead of mostly
presenting a tool, _Wandertext_, which is a web app for creating and sharing
semantically rich geospatial data, I’d rather devote most of the next fifteen
minutes on what I’d hope for the future of whatever follows that which we now
call digital humanities. 

In other words, as UofC likes to boast, “that’s all well and good in practice,
but how does it work in theory?” One way of reading this Chicago undergrad’s
joke is as an adherence to an anti-empiricist value system that rejects messy
practice for clean theory. In what follows, the theory will get plenty messy,
though, and that’s great. It’s the messy theory that makes the praxis human.

## What Is Tiny DH?

Note: I'm going to be talking today about tiny DH. As far as I can tell, I put
the word “tiny” in front of “digital humanities” for the first time, but the
ideas here strike me as rather straightforward and boast a strong intellectual
lineage that I’ve only built upon. Rather explicitly, it has consonances with
Minimal Computing and Micro DH, about which more below. Also explicitly, it is
a practice in tension or perhaps even critique of Big DH. About which, of
course, also more below.

But before talking about friends and family of Tiny DH, I want to note that,
internally, I’ve been calling it mushroom DH with friends and colleagues. To
me, Tiny + mushroom means it should actually be called Toad DH, so here we
are. Hopefully the picture here is one of Toad’s being overwhelmed by
recognition of the DH that bears his name, as opposed to bowled over by
something unmanageable. 

As for the code name Mushroom DH, well its provenance is clear.

> A rush of stories cannot be neatly summed up. Its scales do not nest neatly;
they draw attention to interrupting geographies and tempos…
Yet it is just these interruptions that step out of the bounds of
most modern science, which demands the possibility for infinite expansion
without changing the research framework. Arts of noticing are considered
archaic because they are unable to “scale up” in this way.

--> Tsing, 37–38.

Note: In the Mushroom at the End of the World, Anna Tsing accomplishes a feat
of making a case for an assemblage-driven anthropology that works even harder
to ensure that the communities studied are made up of more than humans. 

This passage gathers a few of Tsing’s terms and help set the stage for what
illuminate what Toad DH, Tiny DH, whatever, might look like. The four terms
are “rush of stories,” “scale,” “science,” and “arts of noticing,” and as I
show how Tsing talks about them, I ask you all to imagine an object of inquiry
like a novel in this space. 

That is, Tsing is talking about the massive assemblage of matsutake mushrooms
that includes their symbiotic pine trees, the often refugee pickers from
southeast Asia who harvest the mushrooms in the Oregon forests, and the rest
that is Tsing, as an anthropologist,’s concern.

## “A rush of stories”

> If a rush of troubled stories is the best way to tell about contaminated
diversity, then it’s time to make that rush part of our knowledge practices.
Perhaps, like the war survivors themselves, we need to tell and tell until all
our stories of death and near-death and gratuitous life are standing with us
to face the challenges of the present [and so] we might encounter our best
hopes for precarious survival.

--> Tsing, 34.

Note: Contamination is a means by which something can become greater than the
sum of its parts, the means by which an object can exhibit emergent
properties. For Tsing, contamination is what we may call being affected, or
being in encounter with. For me, that sounds a lot like reading, where in
reading a text, the reader allows for an affective and aesthetic encounter,
where the reader remains afterward changed. Not only that, but a novel itself
is a nest of encounters. Mikhail Bakhtin discusses the polyphony of the novel,
and Tsing uses “polyphonic” to modify the assemblages tracked in the book.

As polyphonies, the stories and voices rush in all at once, within just this
single object, this single novel. And the reader listens for both moments of
distance, when the voices are far from each other, and moments of harmony or
assonance, when they briefly converge and contaminate.

This rush of stories can overwhelm, like Toad in the earlier slide, and this
rush echoes Lauren Berlant’s idea of genre flailing, responding to crisis by
improvising like crazy. As Berlant writes, “The violence of the world makes us
flail about for things to read with, people to talk to, and material for
inducing transformations... [so that we may] be disturbed together, thrashing
with, and creating value through a shift in the object.” Being disturbed
together, like being contaminated together, becomes an act of solidarity.

## “Its scales do not nest neatly”

> [R]esearch projects often assume the hierarchy in advance, and are set up _a
priori_ to obey its conventions. In short, hierarchical scale is a classic
case of form determining content… whereby objects, events and processes come pre-sorted, ready
to be inserted into the scalar apparatus at hand.

--> Marston _et al._, 422.

Note: In moving from a rush of stories to scale, the slippage grows more
apparent. That is, is the rush of stories our varied readings of a certain
novel or text or object, or is the rush of stories embedded inside the novel,
the Bakhtinian polyphony that gives it its novelistic take? Tsing closes The
Mushroom at the End of the World quoting from Ursula K. Le Guin’s essay “The
Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction,” on how “storytelling [picks] up diverse
things of meaning and value and gather[s] them together like a forager,” but
because the focus of Tsing’s work is the mushroom and its assemblages, Tsing
moves past how Le Guin narrows the carrier bag to the novel itself. 

That is, when Le Guin says that the “natural, proper, fitting shape of the
novel might be that of a sack, a bag,” we can see the novel as an assemblage.
Le Guin continues by saying that a book holds words, and they hold things,
but a bag doesn’t hold just one kind of thing. A bag—the same bag at the same
time—can hold iced coffee in a thermos, two spare ponchos, a MacBook, 18
pieces of chalk each under 2 inches long, and another bag veering on a decade
old used for supplemental grocery shopping. Similarly, a novel doesn’t just or
only contain words. It contains affect, it contains built worlds.

When what’s inside a bag is a question of what happened to be at hand, then
thinking of the bag in scalar terms, especially hierarchical scalar terms
falls under unsupportable scrutiny. The scales of the rush of stories don’t
nest, like Tsing writes, echoing the critique of scale undertaken in human
geography by scholars like Sallie Marston. 

That is, research projects rely on a scalar logic that disturbs or effects the
projects into being. Hierarchical geographical scale should be familiar to all
of us. We’ve used Google Maps’s zoom function to intuit that states contain
counties contain cities contain neighborhoods contain houses. It cannot be
that a city contains a state. But this scale is misleadingly geographical; it
is actually a political hierarchy that has geographical implications, in that
we collect data “at the city level” or “at the census tract level.”

Novels obey no such hierarchical, scalar form. Or at least the affective
response of reading a novel and being contaminated by it should not obey this
form. This might be controversial, as one might respond—and even Le Guin can
be criticzed for this—that of course novels have hierarchies. Novels have
chapters, which have paragraphs, which have sentences, which have words, which
have letters or phonemes or morphemes. And the exceptions to this hierarchy
prove, quote unquote, the rule. We notice when a novel has no chapters. 

But the point of Toad DH, of mushroom and tiny DH, is to resist thinking of
novels in such hierarchical ways.

## The “possibility for infinite expansion”

> Scalability requires that project elements be oblivious to
the indeterminacies of encounter; that’s how they allow smooth expansion.
Thus, too, scalability banishes meaningful diversity, that is, diversity that
might change things.

--> Tsing, 38.

Note: “Does it scale?” is a question that perhaps everyone who has worked in
tech, especially as a web developer, has faced. Sure, your website works when
it’s just you using it, but what if a million people are using it at once? The
ubiquitous fail whale on Twitter of a decade ago was a suggestion, for
example, that Ruby on Rails, the underlying Twitter framework, couldn’t scale
to meet Twitter’s demand.

But if “does it scale” is not familiar, perhaps the dodge of “economies of
scale” resonates more clearly. In an economy of scale, the presumption is that
the contingent parts of a company, or a research project, or whatever, are
interchangeable, such that when two companies merge, one accounting office can
take on the role that was previously served by two separate accounting
offices. Similarly, while it may be very expensive to provide the
infrastructure for one person to use Twitter, by the time it’s ten million
people, the cost per person has cratered.

Scalability only makes sense, as Tsing writes, if everything that makes an
individual an individual is ground out so that the individual can instead
become a data point, we end up deeply in the "technological feast" that is
Donna Haraway's "conquering gaze from nowhere," that space of what Johanna
Drucker calls "observer-independent realism" against which we must contrast
"co-dependent constructivism," lest we, in Drucker's words, cede "the
territory of interpretation to the ruling authority of certainty established
on the false claims of observer-independent objectivity.”

Before moving to Tsing’s last point, arts of noticing, it might now be clear
how mushroom DH distinguishes itself from something that could be considered
mainstream DH or something along those lines.

> Cultural analytics is an emerging field wherein humanist scholars leverage
the increasing availability of large digital corpora and the affordances of
new computational tools. This allows them to study, for example, semantic and
narratological patterns in the English-language novel at the scale of
centuries and across tens-of-thousands of texts.
