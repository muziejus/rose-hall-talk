Note: Thanks to everyone for coming. 

My name is Moacir P. de Sá Pereira, and I'm a librarian at Columbia.

I’ve got my contact information up on this slide, and I’ll show it again at the
end. Though I've been kicking this material around in my head for a few years,
it's in public sort of for the first time today. So please tweet at me, etc.,
if you think of something later or didn’t want to ask during discussion, or
whatever. I'll also have a link at the end to these slides, so you don't have
to rush to take pictures or anything like that.

## Caveat Auditor

</div>

Note: First, a word of warning. The abstract I sent in was supposed to spend a
lot of time discussing a webapp I’m developing called Wandertext. It lets
users create and share semantically rich geospatial data. But having been put
on a panel called “evaluating the future,” I figured that I should rather
devote the next fifteen or so minutes talking about what I’d hope for the
future of whatever it is that will follow that which we now call digital
humanities. 

In other words, as UofC likes to boast, “that’s all well and good in practice,
but how does it work in theory?” One way of reading this Chicago undergrad’s
joke is as an adherence to an anti-empiricist value system that rejects messy
practice for clean theory. In what follows, however, trust me, the theory will
get plenty messy, though, and that’s great. It’s the messy theory that makes
the praxis human.

## What Is Tiny DH?

Note: I'm going to be talking today about tiny DH. As far as I can tell, I was
the first to put the word “tiny” in front of “digital humanities”, but the
what tiny DH is seems to me pretty straightforward. And it certainly boasts a
strong intellectual lineage that I’ve only lightly added to. Rather
explicitly, it has consonances with Minimal Computing and Micro DH, about
which more below.  Also explicitly, it is a practice that stands in tension or
perhaps even in critique of Big DH.  About which, of course, also more below.

But before talking about the friends and family of Tiny DH, I want to note
that, internally, I’ve been calling it mushroom DH while preparing this. And
To me, Tiny + mushroom means it should actually be called Toad DH,
so here we are. 

Hopefully the picture here is one of Toad’s being overwhelmed by recognition
of the DH that bears his name, as opposed to bowled over by something
unmanageable. 

As for the code name Mushroom DH, well its provenance is clear with the next
slide.

> A rush of stories cannot be neatly summed up. Its scales do not nest neatly;
they draw attention to interrupting geographies and tempos…
Yet it is just these interruptions that step out of the bounds of
most modern science, which demands the possibility for infinite expansion
without changing the research framework. Arts of noticing are considered
archaic because they are unable to “scale up” in this way.

--> Tsing, 37–38.

Note: In the Mushroom at the End of the World, Anna Tsing accomplishes a feat
of making a case for an assemblage-driven anthropology that works even harder
to ensure that the communities studied are made up of more than humans.

--> Tsing, 37–38.

Note: This passage gathers a few of Tsing’s terms and helps set the stage for
illuminating what Toad DH, Tiny DH, whatever, might look like. The four terms
of interest are “rush of stories,” “scale,” “science,” and “arts of noticing,”
and as I show how Tsing talks about them, I ask you all to imagine an object
of inquiry like a novel in this space. 

That is, Tsing’s interest is the massive assemblage of matsutake mushrooms.
their symbiotic pine trees, the often refugee pickers from southeast Asia who
harvest the mushrooms in the Oregon forests, the transnational salvage
accumulation that is the international mushroom market, and all the rest that
is for Tsing, as an anthropologist, a primary concern.

But let’s apply the four terms to novels and think through a future for DH.

## “A rush of stories”

> If a rush of troubled stories is the best way to tell about contaminated
diversity, then it’s time to make that rush part of our knowledge practices.
Perhaps, like the war survivors themselves, we need to tell and tell until all
our stories of death and near-death and gratuitous life are standing with us
to face the challenges of the present [and so] we might encounter our best
hopes for precarious survival.

--> Tsing, 34.

Note: Tsing’s book is subtitled On the possibility of life in capitalist
ruins, but I wonder if the pessimism about precarity is similar to what we
heard about yesterday during the keynote, in imagining a future for the
humanities that can only be precarious, forcing us to adapt. Maybe. And Maybe
that’s how Tsing thinks about precarious survival. But key to making that
survival work is this rush of stories that elucidate our contaminated
diversity.

Contamination is the means by which something can become greater than the
sum of its parts, the means by which an object can exhibit emergent
properties. For Tsing, contamination is what we may call being affected, or
being in encounter with. For me, that sounds a lot like reading, where in
reading a text, the reader allows for an affective and aesthetic encounter,
where the reader remains afterward changed. Not only that, but a novel itself
is a nest of encounters. Mikhail Bakhtin discusses the polyphony of the novel,
and Tsing uses “polyphonic” to modify the assemblages tracked in the book.

As polyphonies, the stories and voices rush in all at once, within just this
single object, this single novel. And the reader listens for both moments of
distance, when the voices are far from each other, and moments of harmony or
assonance, when they briefly converge and contaminate.

This rush of stories can overwhelm, like Toad in the earlier slide, and this
rush echoes Lauren Berlant’s idea of genre flailing, responding to crisis by
improvising like crazy. As Berlant writes, “The violence of the world makes us
flail about for things to read with, people to talk to, and material for
inducing transformations... [so that we may] be disturbed together, thrashing
with, and creating value through a shift in the object.” Being disturbed
together, like being contaminated together, becomes an act of solidarity.

## “Its scales do not nest neatly”

> [R]esearch projects often assume the hierarchy in advance, and are set up _a
priori_ to obey its conventions. In short, hierarchical scale is a classic
case of form determining content… whereby objects, events and processes come pre-sorted, ready
to be inserted into the scalar apparatus at hand.

--> Marston _et al._, 422.

Note: In moving from a rush of stories to scale, the slippage grows more
apparent. That is, is this notion of the rush of stories our varied readings
of a certain novel or text or object, or is the rush embedded inside the
novel, the Bakhtinian polyphony that gives the novel its novelistic take?
Tsing closes The Mushroom at the End of the World quoting from Ursula K. Le
Guin’s essay “The Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction,” on how “storytelling [picks]
up diverse things of meaning and value and gather[s] them together like a
forager,” but because the focus of Tsing’s work is the mushroom and its
assemblages, Tsing moves past how Le Guin narrows the carrier bag to the novel
itself. 

That is, when Le Guin says that the “natural, proper, fitting shape of the
novel might be that of a sack, a bag,” we can see the novel as an assemblage.
Le Guin continues by saying that a book holds words, and they hold things,
but a bag doesn’t hold just one kind of thing. A bag—the same bag at the same
time—can hold iced coffee in a thermos, two spare ponchos, a MacBook, 18
pieces of chalk each under 2 inches long, and another bag veering on a decade
old used for supplemental grocery shopping. Similarly, a novel doesn’t just or
only contain words. It contains affect, it contains built worlds.

When what’s inside a bag is a question of what happened to be at hand, then
thinking of the bag in scalar terms, especially hierarchical scalar terms,
falls under unsupportable scrutiny. The scales of the rush of stories don’t
nest, like Tsing writes, echoing the critique of scale undertaken in human
geography by scholars like Sallie Marston. 

That is, research projects rely on a scalar logic that disturbs or effects the
projects into being, and that sets the groundwork for the limit of the new
knowledge we can produce. For example: hierarchical geographical scale should
be familiar to all of us. We’ve used Google Maps’s zoom function to intuit
that states contain counties contain cities contain neighborhoods contain
houses. So these hierarchies direct research, reifying objects as inherently
made up of other objects and subsequent members of larger objects. We look for
data or aim to solve problems at the “census tract level” or the “city level.”

Novels obey no such hierarchical, scalar form. Or at least the affective
response of reading a novel and being contaminated by it should not obey this
form. This might be controversial, as one might respond—and even Le Guin can
be criticzed for this—that of course novels have hierarchies. Novels have
chapters, which have paragraphs, which have sentences, which have words, which
have letters or phonemes or morphemes. And the exceptions to this hierarchy
prove, quote unquote, the rule. We notice when a novel has no chapters. 

But the point of Toad DH, of mushroom and tiny DH, is to resist thinking of
novels in such hierarchical ways.

## The “possibility for infinite expansion” (Science!)

> Scalability requires that project elements be oblivious to
the indeterminacies of encounter; that’s how they allow smooth expansion.
Thus, too, scalability banishes meaningful diversity, that is, diversity that
might change things.

--> Tsing, 38.

Note: The third term, science, relies on scalability.

“Does it scale?” is a question that perhaps everyone who has worked in tech,
especially as a web developer, has faced. Sure, your website works when it’s
just you using it, but what if a million people are using it at once? The
ubiquitous fail whale on Twitter of a decade ago was a suggestion, for
example, that Ruby on Rails, the underlying Twitter framework, couldn’t scale
to meet Twitter’s demand.

But if “does it scale” is not familiar, perhaps the dodge of “economies of
scale” resonates more clearly. In an economy of scale, the presumption is that
the contingent parts of a company, or a research project, or whatever, are
interchangeable, such that when two companies merge, one accounting office can
take on the role that was previously served by two separate accounting
offices. Similarly, while it may be very expensive to provide the
infrastructure for one person to use Twitter, by the time it’s ten million
people, the cost per person has cratered.

Scalability only makes sense, as Tsing writes, if everything that makes an
individual an individual is ground out so that the individual can instead
become a data point. Banish that meaningful diversity, and let’s all gather at
Donna Haraway’s "technological feast" that is the "conquering gaze from
nowhere," that space of what Johanna Drucker calls "observer-independent
realism"

Tsing here builds on the work of Haraway and others, indicting scientism
alongside the critique of scalability. Our rush to get bigger, to enjoy those
economies, smushes people into points. But not just people.

So before moving to Tsing’s last term, arts of noticing, it might now be clear
how mushroom DH distinguishes itself from something that could be considered
mainstream DH. And here I’m thinking about Big DH.

## How Big Is Your DH?

* Humanities benefits from engaging with the digital.
* DH is a meeting place with deep investment.
* DH can save humanities.

--> From Svensson

Note: How Deep Is Your Love by the Bee Gees. Patrik Svensson conveniently lays
out three premises of Big DH in an article of the same name. I’ve simplified
the terms somewhat here, in no disrespect to Svensson, but I’m moving quickly
here. There’s an optimistic pluralism at work in this view of Big DH, big
because of its large tent with unprecedented diversity within. And off that
bigness follows big money and with big money comes big staff and big
computers, and big computers want big data to do that big DH.

The bigness of DH, as seen in terms of deep academic
investment in labor and capital, becomes matched by a similar academic push to
pursue bigger projects and bigger questions and solve the world.

<h2>So <span style="font-size: 50%">smol</h2>

<div class="flex">
<div class="w-50">

### Micro DH

* Inclusive across academic hierarchies, institution types, and geographies
* Uses small data sets and local archives
* Relies on freely available platforms

--> From Risam & Edwards

</div>
<div class="w-50">

### Minimal Computing

* Reduces “costs”
* Simplifies design
* Answers “what do we need?”

--> From Gil

</div>
</div>

Note: In contrast, Minimal Computing and Micro DH, suggest different value
systems and points of entry into digital humanistic scholarship. Micro DH is
the term coined by Roopika Risam and Susan Edwards in looking at DH at Salem
State, and we heard about that some yesterday. Its microness is the key to its
diversity, making use of nimble movement on a wide array of terrains to
generate pluralism one edge at a time, instead of under one big roof.

Minimal computing, on the other hand, aims for a more actively technical way
of thinking about DH, but one that becomes diverse and pluralistic in its
accessibility. Minimal Computing can mean a lot of things, but one consistent
thread is the idea of scholars in the Caribbean passing around digital
projects on USB keys, foregrounding a practice that doesn’t take the cloud for
granted.

I’ve mentioned these two terms at the opening of this talk, but I want to
leave this marker fresh in your minds as I boomerang back into Big DH.

## A rush of stories, scale, science,<br> and arts of noticing

> Cultural analytics is an emerging field wherein humanist scholars leverage
the increasing availability of large digital corpora and the affordances of
new computational tools. This allows them to study, for example, semantic and
narratological patterns in the English-language novel at the scale of
centuries and across tens-of-thousands of texts.

--> So, Long, Zhu

Note: We have an overwhelming stream of voices in the novel, we’re overwhelmed
by what we read and the worlds to which we’re introduced as we turn the pages.
These novels are shaggy misshapen beasts, challenging scalar hierarchies and
forever reaffirming a skepticism toward the scientistic tendency of
flattening, of generalizing. This contamination, this encounter that Tsing
studies in terms of the matsutake mushroom describes so well the same sense of
literary study in which I was trained and which brought me to literature in
the first place. 

And then I read something like this description of cultural analytics, from an
essay published this year, and see what bigness has wrought, where the ability
to study “the English-language novel at the scale of centuries and across
tens-of-thousands of texts” is seen as a cause for celebration.

Mushroom DH could be arguing that the solution to the slaughterhouse of
literature isn’t pretending to read all the things. The solution might just be
to make what one reads count. To get tiny, and to be like mushrooms,
symbiotic, affecting and being affected by. Having encounters of the sort and
at the level where both objects get perturbed, enjoying and relishing your own
critical hand in the work instead of aiming to erase it with the conquering
gaze from nowhere.

## Almost Noticing

> Because you think description is easy? You must be confusing it, I guess,
with strings of clichés… To describe, to be attentive to the concrete state
of affairs, to find the uniquely adequate account of a given situation, I
myself have always found this incredibly demanding.

--> Latour, 144

Note: In a signature comic interlude, Bruno Latour orchestrates a conversation
between a graduate student and a professor at the London School of Economics,
where the student bristles at being told to “just describe the state of
affairs at hand.” Calling that view naive, the student expresses surprise at
how unsophisticated the professor is, who responds, “Because you think
description is easy? You must be confusing it, I guess, with strings of
clichés. To describe, to be attentive to the concrete state of affairs, to
find the uniquely adequate account of a given situation, I myself have always
found this incredibly demanding.”

Heather Love takes up this notion of description again in “Close but not
Deep,” but Love uses the descriptive turn in the social sciences to link
textual scholarship up with distant reading, in claiming that statistical
analysis enacts a return to empiricism that “makes description--but not close
reading--central.”

This is a worrying wedding I see repeated in descriptions, as it were, of
surface reading. If we are reading closely, then we must be aiming to find
what Latour calls that uniquely adequate account of a situation, but I argue
that precisely that idea of uniqueness is washed away in the datasets of big
DH.

## Arts of Noticing

> In this last mushroom flush, a final upsurge in the face of varied coming
droughts and winters, I search for fugitive moments of entanglement in the
midst of institutionalized alienation… Given this negative character, it makes
no sense to crystallize first principles or seek natural laws that generate
best cases. Instead, I practice arts of noticing. I comb through the mess of
existing worlds-in-the-making, looking for treasures—each distinctive and
unlikely to be found again, at least in that form.

--> Tsing, 255.

Note: And finally we’re at the Arts of Noticing themselves. This quoted
section is the last time Tsing refers to the arts, and we can see what the
benefit of noticing is. Tsing combs through the mess of existing
worlds-in-the-making, aiming to find these rare moments of distinction, from
which the uniquely adequate account can follow, understanding the ephemerality
and irreproducibility of these rushes of different stories.

---

## Tiny / Mushroom / Toad DH

* Overwhelmed by the single aesthetic encounter
* Making do with non-hierarchical scale
* Affecting and affected by the object, situated
* Noticing the worlds-in-the-making, grasping at moments

Note: And so that’s how I aim to evaluate the future, or think about the
future of DH. We should build on Micro DH and Minimal Computing with Tiny DH,
returning back to the scene of encounter with the objects we study and
thinking about that encounter itself, noticing and renoticing it.
